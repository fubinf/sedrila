- `author`: introduced `participants` config setting (not actually used yet!)

- `author`, `instructor`: introduced `former_instructors` config setting

## Version 2.9.0 (2025-08-19)
- `author`: taskgroup-level non-md files are now copied to targetdir verbatim (for images, downloads, etc.)
- `instructor`, `student`: Defend against dangerous paths and control chars in student metadata 


## Version 2.8.1 (2025-08-15)
- `instructor`: pull repo whenever workdir is clean
- docs: Instructor documentation now explains when and how to import the other instructors' public keys.


## Version 2.8.0 (2025-08-07)
- `server`: small new command: A trivial personal webserver to be used by course authors
  for viewing the current rendered version of the course.


## Version 2.7.0 (2025-07-07)
- `author`: In the glossary, `[TOC]` ignores headings and instead makes an alphabetical list of 
  all term entries (main terms and synonyms).


## Version 2.6.4 (2025-04-29)
- FIX: `pyproject.toml` must declare `numpy<2`, although `pandas` (who needs this) correctly declares it.
  Reason unclear.


## Version 2.6.3 (2025-04-29)
- `instructor`/`student`: FIX: accept signatures with unknown validity


## Version 2.6.2 (2025-04-14)
- `author`: add `--rename old_partname new_partname` refactoring function.
- `student`: FIX: sedrila student failed to read the commit history when submission.yaml was empty


## Version 2.6.1 (2025-04-08)
- `student`: refuse to run if the work directory given does not contain a `.git` subdir.
- `student`: if `student.yaml` is missing, mention `--init`.


## Version 2.6.0 (2025-02-10)
- `instructor1` removed.
- `viewer` removed. This functionality is now covered by the 'webapp' function of
  `student` and `instructor`.
- `student`: completely rewritten. Except for `--init` and `--import-keys`, the usual form of use is now
  menu-driven, with operations 'prepare', 'webapp', 'edit', 'commit', and 'push'.
  The webapp also shows a) a list of tasks (based on contents of 'submission.yaml' and commit messages)
  and allows selecting/unselecting them for submission, and b) the report on work done so far.  
  The previous terminal-based task selection and work report were removed.
- `instructor`: rewritten, to make it analogous to `student`.  
  Here, the webapp allows clicking on usernames near files or tasks in order to accept/reject/keepneutral
  the corresponding task. Each such change is reflected in `submission.yaml` immediately.  
  The work report is available here as well.


## Version 2.5.0 beta (2025-01-28)
- `viewer`: completely new viewer that can browse several directory trees at once and will
  mark most files that pertain to some task given in `submission.yaml`.
- `student`: Five fields are now mandatory in `student.yaml` (in order to support `viewer` and `instructor`):
  `course_url`, `student_fullname`, `student_id`, `student_gituser`, `partner_gituser`; 
  the latter (and only the latter) may be empty. 
- `instructor1`: is what `instructor` was formerly, while `instructor` is being re-designed.
- `instructor`: is now a menu-driven interactive command and can also work on several student workdirs at once.
  So far, it can only perform pull, viewer, and commit&push, but has no actual task-marking functionality.
  INCOMPLETE.
- `student` and `instructor1` are prone to have defects, but `viewer` is useful.
- Documentation "General ideas" now describes the four different directory hierarchies involved.
- Documentation "Architecture" now specifies module layers.
- Ctrl-C now always terminates without a stack trace.


## Version 2.4.0 (2025-01-13)
- `author`: Remove the ToC at bottom of homepages of course, chapter, or taskgroup
- `viewer`: Ctrl-C now only prints a nice exit message.
- `viewer`: Show all files named like submitted entries (in any directory) together
- `viewer`: Provide favicon


## Version 2.3.0 (2024-10-10)
- `author`: FIX: generate .htaccess again (was missing since 2.0.0)
- `viewer`: make shellprompt recognition more liberal
- `viewer`: allow .prot files to lie in subdirectories rather than at top level


## Version 2.2.1 (2024-08-27)
- `instructor`: forgotten FIX: ignore Taskgroups in `require` when checking


## Version 2.2.0 (2024-08-26)
- `viewer`: add link to show `*.html` as a page instead of its source
- `student`: FIX: ignore Taskgroups in `require` when checking


## Version 2.1.2 (2024-08-20)
- `student`: FIX: repair broken get_metadata() that led to a crash


## Version 2.1.1 (2024-08-20)
- `author`: add the forgotten documentation for the new `[PROT]` macro.
- `author`: HTML now uses more semantic markup: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`,
  `role=`
- (all): FIX: repair search for `pyproject.toml`, which is broken in the wheel version of the PyPI package


## Version 2.1.0 (2024-08-19)
- `author`: make `[TERMREF2::class::--like]` work correctly.
- `author`: suppress info line on instructor file x when there was one on student file x
- `viewer`: (new role): special-purpose webserver for browsing a student repo


## Version 2.0.0 beta (2024-08-02) 
- `author` optimization: sedrila now uses an incremental build, supported by a cache.
  Build time reduces tenfold in typical cases.
  The previous simplistic cache and its `--cache` option were removed.
  The code base has been greatly reorganized accordingly and is now cleaner and clearer.
  Use `--clean` to start with an empty cache if desired (there is rarely a need for it).
  Output now reports which files are built; use `--log WARNING` to silence this.
- `author` harmonization: in `sedrila.yaml`, 'slug' and 'breadcrumb_title' are renamed into 'name'.
  (In the resulting `course.json`, 'slug' is deprecated, but still available for the time being,
  so that students/instructors can continue to use sedrila 1.3 when authors start using sedrila 2.0.
  Version mixing is not well tested, though.)
- `author` simplification: `assumes` and `requires` now allow any type of part.
  The `minimum` attribute in taskgroup files is no longer supported.
  The (undocumented) `todo` attribute in taskgroup files is no longer supported.
- `author` feature: sedrila now also supports table syntax in Markdown.
- `author`: FIX: added missing documentation for macro `[TERMREF2]`.
- `author`: FIX: the reported number of errors is no longer inflated.
- `instructor`: can now change previous accept/reject decisions``

- `author`: documentation describes how to get an English translation using ChatGPT.


## Version 1.3.1 (2024-06-07) 
- `author`: FIX: generated `course.json` now includes the required attribute `altdir`
