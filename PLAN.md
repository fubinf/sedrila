In authors.md, 
chapter 1 is about static content, 
chapter 2 is about how to call sedrila for rendering that into HTML.
Chapter 1 is overloaded.
I want to move some of its contents to a new chapter 2.
However, some of that content-to-move is intertwined with other content that should stay.
Make the necessary repairs in the prose to maintain a logical and helpful train of thought.

Move stuff as follows and make intelligent decisions yourself where less detail is given:
- rename chapter 3 and its sections to become chapter 4.
- rename chapter 2 and its sections to become chapter 3.
- move current sections 1.6 to 1.9 to become new sections 2.1 to 2.4.
- extract the macro-related material (and only that, no the other discussion) from current 1.11 and 1.14 
  and create appropriate places for it in new chapter 2. 
  If needed, put forward references or other repairs into what is now 1.11 and 1.14
  so as to keep them intelligible.
- move old 1.4 to become new 2.x after the above material
- move the old 2.3.1 (now 3.3.1) into a suitable place in new chapter 2, 
  probably shortly after its cousin [INCLUDE].
- move the old 2.3.2 (new 3.3.2) into a suitable place in new chapter 2, 
  probably after all the other things.
- rewrite old 1.3 to be an announcement of the broader types of markups discussed in new chapter 2.
- write a new section 2.0 with quick overview of the new chapter 2,
  just a bit more detailed than 1.3.
